spaceship gaem


if you're here you probably were sent here

if by some god awful chance you stumbled upon this and weren't already aware of it, this is a space gaem made in godot

very unfinished

releases are far behind; download as source and open as a godot project

you can find releases there, or you can download the .zips directly from the root directory
do not download just the .exe, you'll be missing the content
